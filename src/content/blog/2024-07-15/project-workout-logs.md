## Overview of Integrating Workout Logs into Looker Studio

I integrated Spreadsheet into Looker Studio for monitoring workouts.

Recently, I've recorded weight and count while working out in gyms, and Looker Studio shows how much I did by multiplying them.

The issue before creating this was that I was supposed there was no tool combined with weight and count, and monitoring them without pay. There are some nice options for workout logs in Google Play Store, but it didn't seem to fill my requirements, especially in terms of monitoring them in Looker Studio.

This integration is achieved by Looker Studio, Spread Sheet, and Google Apps Script built by Typescript with Clasp.

Here's my GitHub repository for this project: [gas-workout-logs](https://github.com/uuta/gas-workout-logs)
