## Version

- GO: 1.21.3

## Goal

Get to know how to use Firebase Auth

## Tech stack

## Perspectives

- How much is the expected cost?
- Does Firebase Authentication provide UI to authenticate?
  Firebase doens't seem to provide UI to authenticate, so I would need to create UI in Flutter. I suppose there's no need to add email and password forms, but only put a button to authenticate with Google account.
- Does Firebase Authentication provide SDK for APIs in Rust? Is it easy to use?

## What get stuck

## My opinion
